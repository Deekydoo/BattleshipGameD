# BattleshipGameD
Battleship game assignment for school

To play run main.py

navigate using up and down arrow keys, select with enter key, and q is a shortcut to end the program

It stores all game results to a corresponding local txt file, and you can see the game history and leaderboards by navigating to it in the UI.

leaderboards are sorted by least amount of tries and least amount of time.

Thank you and have fun!
